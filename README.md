WORK IN PROGRESS

Those scripts were made for me from my specific needs, they are available to you.
They are scripts, they are not meant to be behind a web interface some day.
Minimum error checks are performed.
I am not using a database cause I won't gather that much data and it would break me to the name of 'script'.
The performances and the overall design of those scripts might be horrible to you, keep in mind that I made them mainly for me, they were never suppose to be in a production environment :)
